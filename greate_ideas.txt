- tamagotchi who wants to die
- flappybird / canabalt but you control the pipes/buildings
- minesweeper but you give the result of a click on a random tile (from a pile of random numbers, tetris style)
- tower defense but you are a disgruntled employee that places buildings that heal /buff the orcs while other employees do the opposite

- Bark Mrown presents: .jrpg party but switch roles (both parties show intentions, and you give yours a role for that turn?)
    - hat pool / draw?
	- hat of everyone on screen (party + enemies)
	   - constant all battle?
	   - random each turn?
